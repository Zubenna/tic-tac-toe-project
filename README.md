# Tic Tac Toe Game

The aim of this project is to build a Tic Tac Toe Game using ruby language.

This project is about coding the Tic Tac Toe Game using the concept of object oriented programming. Here, we explored the use of classes, methods and variables. We also explored the application of these terms in solving a problem. It involves breaking the problem into smaller piece and units, defined a pseudocode on how to solve these problems, wrote a mock solution to the problem and then wrote a proper ruby code arranged in classes and methods combined and arranged properly to solve this problem.

## How to Play

This game is designed to be played by two human players.
On launching the game, it will display an empty board containing numbers 0 to 8 indicating the empty positions, players will chose.
- The Game will prompt the first player to enter his name
- After the first player enters his name, the players name will be validated to ensure that it meets the basic name specificationi of the game. The name entered must contain only alphabets, letter A to Z. Digits and special characters are not accepted as path of the name. The name must contain minimum of three letters.
- After the name validation, the game prompts the second player to enter his/her name. After entering the name, name validation also takes place as described above.
- If both players name are accepted, the game prompts the first player to select a symbol either **X**  or **Y**. The game will not accept any other symbol outside the one specified and will inform the user if wrong selection is made.
- If first player selects **X**, **Y** will be automatically assigned to the second player and vise versa.
- If the game accepts the symbols, It will prompt the first player to play. The board contains numbers from 0 to 8 representng the nine differet positions in a Tic Tac Toe game.
- To play, the current player will enter any number between 0 to 8. Numbers outside 0 to 8 will not be accepted and the game will display a message when that occurs. If the number is accepted, the game replace that position on the board with the symbol assigned to that player. It will also display the current state of the board.
